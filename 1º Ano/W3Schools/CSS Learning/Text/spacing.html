    <h1>Usando text-indent</h1>

    <p class="indent">In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice
        that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,
        ' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages
        that you've had.'</p>
